YAPL (Your Own Programming Language)-Interpreter

3 parts: 1. The lexer takes input (High Level Language) and breaks it into a sequence of tokens.
	 2. The parser takes these tokens and outputs a parse tree where each branch is filled with your expressions or statements.
	 3. The interpreter which goes through each branch, evaluates it, and executes your statements.
